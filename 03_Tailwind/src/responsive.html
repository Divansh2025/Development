  <!-- just like media query: sm: 640px md:...... -->
  <!-- tailwind is designed based on mobile first: means if sm: text-sm then it would do opposite of what you think -->
  <!-- min-h-screen = min-height : 100vh -->
  <!-- in tailwind sm means what you have written is for mobile screen, if you put breakpoint 'sm' then
    it means >=640px then do xyz..... -->
  <!-- so think sm after / as small breakpoint -->
